He's been having a lot of bone pain lately, especially in his back and hips, and he even fractured a bone with very little impact. Could it be something serious? \n"," Answer: \n"," Yes, bone pain and fractures can be serious and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. It's important to note that fractures can be caused by a variety of conditions, including osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, and other musculoskeletal disorders. It's important to note that the severity of the bone pain and fracture should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate course of treatment.\n","\n","Question: \n"," Can you tell me other symptoms about the disease \n"," Answer: \n"," Some other symptoms of osteoporosis include:\n","* Bone pain and tenderness in the affected area\n","* Muscle weakness and fatigue\n","* Waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs or standing up from a chair\n","* Bone and muscle tenderness on pressure\n","* Fractures of the ribs and pelvis\n","* Osteomalacia in adults can present with fractures and low BMD, mimicking osteoporosis.\n","\n","Question: \n"," Can you tell me about the diagnosis procedure? \n"," Answer: \n"," The diagnostic procedure for osteoporosis is to measure bone mineral density (BMD) using a bone density test such as a X-ray or a computed tomography (CT) scan. The lower limit of normal for sex-matched young adults is used to establish the diagnosis. The World Health Organization nomenclature uses the term osteopenia to refer to individuals whose BMD is between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass and the term osteoporosis to refer to individuals whose BMD is below 1.0 standard deviation below peak bone mass.\n","\n","Question: \n"," Can you tell the treatment procedure? \n"," Answer: \n"," The treatment procedure for osteoporosis depends on its cause and the stage of the illness. If a secondary cause of osteoporosis is present, specific treatment should be aimed at correcting the underlying disorder. During the acute phase of vertebral compression, attention is directed toward relieving pain with analgesics, muscle relaxants, heat, massage, and/or rest. Many patients with discomfort related to osteoporotic fractures or deformity benefit from a well-designed program of physical therapy. Some patients appear to benefit from a corset or an orthopedic back brace. Both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercises can help improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. In mildly affected, older women, estrogen treatment has been advocated, particularly 1403 to blunt bone resorption, but long-term efficacy is unknown. The only alternative to surgery at present is conservative medical follow-up. Most experts recommend surgery for all patients with symptomatic disease and even for asymptomatic patients meeting other, somewhat arbitrary, criteria, such as age younger than 70. In any case, regardless of the underlying cause, osteomalacia associated with adult acquired Fanconi's syndrome appears to respond well to treatment with phosphate.\n","\n","Question: \n"," Can you tell me the possible causes of the disease? \n"," Answer: \n"," The possible causes of osteoporosis include age-related osteoporosis, which is caused by the natural decline in bone density with age, and osteoporosis associated with the inheritance of genetic variants that regulate bone density. Secondary causes of osteoporosis include idiopathic osteoporosis, which is caused by no specific underlying cause, and osteoporosis associated with a variety of diseases and drug treatments. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is also a possibility.\n","\n","Begin Conversation 2.0\n","Question: \n"," My friend has been experiencing persistent coughing, sometimes with blood, along with fatigue and weight loss.

The liver may become damaged and may not function properly for the rest of the person's life. This can lead to liver failure, which can cause chronic liver disease and other health problems. It's important to note that yellow fever is a serious illness and should be treated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. If your friend has been diagnosed with yellow fever, they should receive appropriate treatment to prevent complications and improve their overall health.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# model.memory.clear()"],"metadata":{"id":"dSNOVms1XH6m","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714243079638,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Myo Thiha","userId":"00141362449010417331"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["eval_dataset"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"TA1pQGVneA2u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714243079639,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Myo Thiha","userId":"00141362449010417331"}},"outputId":"7b032403-bf3b-4ebf-c5ad-3148e876c2d6"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["      SN                                           Question  \\\n","0    1.0  I'm worried about my friend.

CT scanning is the most commonly used imaging test for diagnosing appendicitis, as it can visualize the right lower quadrant and the appendix, and can help exclude other causes of abdominal pain. Physical examination is also an important tool in diagnosing appendicitis, as it can help identify any underlying causes of the pain. Laparoscopic tests and abdominal imaging studies are also used to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. However, it's important to note that a firm diagnosis before laparotomy is the rule today, and surgical exploration when the appendix is normal is entirely acceptable given the increase in morbidity and mortality with appendiceal rupture.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["answers = 'Answers.xlsx'\n","eval_dataset.to_excel(answers, index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"G1I86loXXGhh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714243079639,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Myo Thiha","userId":"00141362449010417331"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import locale\n","def getpreferredencoding(do_setlocale = True):\n","    return \"UTF-8\"\n","locale.getpreferredencoding = getpreferredencoding"],"metadata":{"id":"v9oqE1GG6iz0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714244171152,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":389,"user":{"displayName":"Myo Thiha","userId":"00141362449010417331"}}},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ans_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/NLP/Project/datasets/\"\n","!cp $answers $ans_path"],"metadata":{"id":"q3-7JHxk-Vxu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714244173876,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":679,"user":{"displayName":"Myo Thiha","userId":"00141362449010417331"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_question = \"I have a cold and nosebleed.
